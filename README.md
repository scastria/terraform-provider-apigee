# Looking for collaborators
I no longer have access to ANY Apigee product so I cannot test this provider.  I am looking for volunteers to be
collaborators to this provider.  The qualifications I am looking for is someone that has made a PR to any terraform
provider.  Please contact me in the Issues section.
